# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets (Data Quest - Guided Project)
In this project, I analyzed data from Google Play Store and App Store. The goal was to define most profitable free apps for English-language target audience of both stores. 

The project documentation consists of the following files:
  1. Google Play Store data - <a href = 'https://github.com/mdrobovtseva/DQ---GP---Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets/blob/master/googleplaystore.csv'>googleplaystore.csv </a>
  2. App Store data - <a href = 'https://github.com/mdrobovtseva/DQ---GP---Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets/blob/master/AppleStore.csv'>AppleStore.csv</a>
  3. Python code for the project - ProfitableAppProfiles
  
While analyzing data, I found several results that could be useful for app developers:
1. While App Store has more fun apps (with Games being the biggest in terms of the amount of apps genre), Google Play Store contains more practically oriented apps.
2. The most popular genres are dominated by the most popular apps, giants of the industry (e.g, Google Maps for Navigation genre, Facebook for Communication/Social Networking, etc.). 
3. In both stores genre 'Reference' / 'Books and References' do not have a lot of competition (though Bible is the most popular app), and creating a fun reference app could be a good idea for filling the niche.
