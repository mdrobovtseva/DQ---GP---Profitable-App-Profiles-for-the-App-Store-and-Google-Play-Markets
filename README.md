# DQ---GP---Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets
In this project, I analyzed data from Google Play Store and App Store. The goal was to define most profitable free apps for English-language target audience of both stores. 

The project documentation consists of the following files:
  1. Google Play Store data - <a href = 'https://github.com/mdrobovtseva/DQ---GP---Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets/blob/master/googleplaystore.csv'>googleplaystore.csv </a href>
  2. App Store data - AppleStore.csv
  3. Python code for the project - ProfitableAppProfiles
  
While analyzing data, I found several results I would like to share:
1. While App Store has more fun, non-practical apps, Google Play Store has more practical apps
2. The most popular genres are dominated by the most popular apps (e.g, Google Maps for Navigation genre, Facebook for Communication/Social Networking, etc.). 
3. In both stores genre 'Reference' / 'Books and References' do not have a lot of competition (though Bible is the most popular app), and creating a fun reference app could be a good idea for app developers.
